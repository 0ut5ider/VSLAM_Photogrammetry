# CAD files

This the current state of the CAD parts. The 7z file is a compressed STP file.
Create your own STL files for all the parts if you want to 3D print.

### Notes on hole sizes
All the 2mm holes are meant to be threaded. Drill out using 2.5mm drill, and tap to M3 

All 4.6mm holes are meant to receive a M3 threaded insert.

All the 3mm holes likely need to be opened up with a drill agter 3d printing.
